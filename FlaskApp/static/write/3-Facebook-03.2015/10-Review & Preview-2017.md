2017 review & 2018 preview

2017 is quite a different year. I switched the team and worked on different technologies. My previous team was great, awesome manager, great rating, comfortable work life balance. So, I did prepare for the hardest, but it turned out to be harder. Newsfeed is one of the most hardcore team in the company, and my previous experiences became almost useless. I made horrible mistakes, screwed up projects, went through a long and painful journey. But I didn't regret. Because I know, the more difficulty it is, the more opportunities it has.

-- Highlight
1. Worked with talented programmers: they are smart, sharp, productive, hardworking. Their talent deeply surprised me. I learnt from them.
2. Worked on coolest systems: built and maintained real-time distributed system with 100k servers and 1M qps, optimized and debugged high performance programs
3. Understood how does newsfeed (core service in facebook) work from infra system perspective
4. Dived into low-level technics: thread scheduling, sync/async request serving, folly future.

-- Lowlight
- Wasn't able to sell achivements properly and make larger visibilty and impacts
- Wasn't able to clearly communicate with managers on project goals and progresses
- Wasn't able to smoothly convince colleagues when coflict

2018 Goals
- Technical:
1. Further dive into low level technics including Thrift, folly, Eventbase, lock, thraed model. Understand rationales behind.
2. Improve productivity by better leveraing bash commends and linux tools
3. Get familiar with basic ranking technics and workflows 
- Non-technical
1. Practice technical writting skills. Be able to describe technical problems in a clear and succinct way quickly
2. Be able to clearly communicate with manager and align on project goals and progresses
3. Practice to clearly measure and describe the impact and sell to others
4. A lot more but lets first focus on those above
