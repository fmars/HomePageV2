Review of 02.2017 to 12.2017
2017 was quite an unusual year. I joined a new team, switched a few managers, and switched several directions and projects. 
In the new team, I worked on some cool projects that wanted to work on but never got a chance to work on, learnt some hardcore technics that wanted to learn but never got a chance to learn, worked with some telent engineers that I wanted to work with but never got chance to work with. In the new team, meanwhile, I wasted lots of time, suffered through tough process to get used to the new team and work style. 2017 was a mix of good and bad. 

-- Good
1. Got chance to work with most talented engineers. They are smarter, more knowledgable, and more responsible. Working with them was the great experience.
2. Got chance to work on cool projects and hardcore technics - distributed system, improving performance, debugging race condition, etc. 
3. Got familiar with core component of facebook service.

-- Bad
