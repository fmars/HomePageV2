  <body><span style="font-size: large;">Here is a brief summary talking about common STL Container used in Leetcode problems.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Sequence Containers:</li>
<ol>
<li>Vector.&nbsp;</li>
<ol>
<li>Just like the array in c language that random access runs in constant time.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Implemented by the dynamic array ensuring that the amortized time of push_back and pop_back is constant time.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Modify elements other then the last element run in O(n) time&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<li>Deque.</li>
<ol>
<li>Random access runs in constant time as well</li>
<li>Implemented by double dynamic array I guess thus can push and pop elements both at the end and the front in constant time</li>
<li>Modify elements other than the first and last elements run in O(n) time.</li>
</ol>
<li>List</li>
<ol>
<li>Like linked list in c language that random access will runs in O(n) time</li>
<li>Obviously that insert and delete element run in constant time</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<li>Container Adapters:</li>
<ol>
<li>Stack and Queue.</li>
<li>Priority Queue</li>
</ol>
<li>Associative Containers:</li>
<ol>
<li>Set.</li>
<ol>
<li>Implemented by binary search tree (not hash table), thus the time complexity of insert and erase are O(logn)</li>
</ol>
<li>Map</li>
<ol>
<li>The same method with set thus [ ] &nbsp;operator is O(logn)</li>
</ol>
<li>Unordered_Set and Unordered_Map</li>
<ol>
<li>New in C++11 that insert erase and [] operators run in O(1) or O(n)</li>
<li>Implemented by hash table</li>
<li>The advantage of set over unordered_set is set requires limited memory in proportion to the input size</li>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
Sequnce Containers can be used in Sort function directly with customized compare function.<br />
