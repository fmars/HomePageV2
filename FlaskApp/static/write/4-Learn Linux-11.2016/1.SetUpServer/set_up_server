Before purchasing Linux Foundation SysAdmin course which costs $500, I decided first to build my old desktop as a server and to serve my homepage. After that if I still find SysAdmin interesting, then I will get that course and exam.

During the process to learn how to set up server, I found SysAdmin is even more interesting than I execpted. The more I did, the more fun I got. Such as scp from my mac to a ubuntu virtual host on my desktop, ssh from virtual host to old destop, etc. 

Basically I set up apache server, flask, ssh server. I also configed Port Forwarding and Static IP Address. Now my old desktop can fully perform as a server. It's now hosting my home page which has been migrated from AWS. After rebind it in Amazon Route53 my donmain name was bind to my desktop as well.

Cannot access homepage within local network through public IP. This is due to loopback problem http://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Hairpin_NAT
